# NPTEL Dark Mode Chrome Extension

## Problem Statement
NPTEL (National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning) provides online courses for a wide range of subjects. However, the default light theme of the NPTEL website may cause eye strain during prolonged study sessions, especially in low-light environments. This Chrome extension addresses this issue by adding a dark mode to the NPTEL website, making it more comfortable for users to study at night or in dimly lit conditions.


```
  Note: Currently, this feature is implemented only for course pages. It does not apply to the homepage or other pages of the NPTEL website.
```
## Features
- Toggle Dark Mode: Switch between dark and light themes with a simple checkbox.
- Automatic Application: Dark mode is applied automatically if the user has previously enabled it.
- User-Friendly Interface: A minimalistic and sleek toggle switch for easy activation.
